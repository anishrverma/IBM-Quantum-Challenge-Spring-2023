# IBM Quantum Challenge Spring 2023

This repository contains my solutions for the IBM Quantum Challenge Spring 2023.

Lab 1 is a crash course in to dynamic circuits, Lab 2 goes through quantum teleportation, Lab 3 focuses on iterative phase estimation, and Lab 4 runs us through quantum error correction, and Lab 5 allows us to set up a GHz state for use on a 127-qubit system (IBM Sherbrooke).

More information about the challenge can be found in IBM's [announcement blog](https://research.ibm.com/blog/quantum-challenge-spring-2023) and the [FAQ / Wiki](https://github.com/qiskit-community/ibm-quantum-challenge-spring-2023/wiki).
